### Program Description:

This program exhibits a brief experiment on consciousness. It asks the user to define consciousness, and then attempts to respond to them in a way that might cause them to have to reconsider.

### Installation Description:
You will need to make sure that you have Python installed in whichever Jupyter notebook you clone this repository too. If you do, you should just be able to run the notebook. 

### Usage:
The program is rather simple - all you need to do is follow the prompts. It may be a more pleasurable experience if you also try to think about it a bit.
