# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Thinking before you speak
* Creating thought-out, rational defenses for your beliefs and actions
* Defending those defenses with all of your rigor and aptitude

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Uttering the phrase "lets just agree to disagree"
* Being nice (as differentiated from kind, which is good)
* Ad hominem arguments
* All illogical arguments
* The word belief

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Anyone who disobeys is subject to a callout from a group leader.
## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
three hops from Mr. Berniwisky's Chamber in an easterlyward direction.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with

permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
